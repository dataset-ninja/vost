**VOST: Video Object Segmentation under Transformations Dataset** is a dataset for instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, object detection, and identification tasks. It is applicable or relevant across various domains. Also, it is used in the food industry. 

The dataset consists of 67750 images with 473218 labeled objects belonging to 141 different classes including *onion*, *dough*, *potato*, and other: *carrot*, *paint*, *garlic*, *peach*, *tomato*, *paper*, *bag*, *cheese*, *wood*, *courgette*, *cards*, *clay*, *cloth*, *broccoli*, *olive*, *cucumber*, *film*, *pepper*, *gourd*, *food*, *banana*, *iron*, *batter*, *container*, *meat*, and 113 more.

Images in the VOST dataset have pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. There are 514 (1% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 2 splits in the dataset: *train* (59930 images) and *val* (7820 images). Additionally, every image marked with its ***action*** and ***sequence*** tags. The dataset was released in 2023 by the <span style="font-weight: 600; color: grey; border-bottom: 1px dashed #d3d3d3;">Toyota Research Institute, USA</span>.
